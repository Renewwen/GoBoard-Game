# Killer_Chess-Game
A Unity Game Project: Turn-based strategy game
- Playable Demo: http://matrixwayne.itch.io/killer-chess 
- Utilize C# and Unity 3D to script functions and restrictions of the chessboard, the interaction logic between character and enemies, and a series of abilities for some specific enemies.
- Created and adjusted the characters and scene modelings by using Maya, and use iTween to set animations.
- Playtested by a bunch of people on the Boston Game Expo and get overwhelmingly positive feedback. 

Game Description:
It’s a turn-based strategy game. 

For each level, the propose of the player is to move the character step by step from the start node to the end node. the     player can only move the character one step for each turn. when the player moved, the enemies would move at the same time. The player needs to avoid or kill the enemies to find a way out! 

Levels will become more difficult and complex as the player progresses.

The new type of enemies and game mechanics will be introduced in the game progresses.

Enemies positions and behavior will be designed delicately, like a puzzle. 


How to Play:
Using "W"  "A"   "S"  "D" or “←”，“→”，“↑”，“↓”  to control the moving directions of character.
